# Theory of FM（Factorization Machines） Algorithm
## 1.Background


Click-through rate is a very important link in computational advertising and recommendation system. It is necessary to determine whether an item is recommended or not according to CTR. The commonly used methods in the industry are artificial feature engineering + LR (logistic regression), GBDT(gradient boosting decision tree),[FM(factorization machine)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf) and FFM(field-aware factorization machine) model. In recent years, there have been many improved methods based on FM, such as
